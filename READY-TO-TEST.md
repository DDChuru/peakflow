## What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Import Bank Statement

1. Open your application
2. Navigate to: `/workspace/Na1KU0ogKFLJ5cUzrMrU/bank-import`
3. Select bank statement or upload new one
4. Map transactions (should auto-map using 182 existing rules)
5. Post to ledger
6. Note:
   - How many transactions imported
   - Any errors or warnings
   - Completion time

### Step 2: Notify Claude

After completing the import, tell Claude:

```
Import complete!
- Imported: [X] transactions
- Posted at: [time]
- Any issues: [describe if any]
```

### Step 3: Claude Runs Verification

Claude will run:
```bash
node scripts/verify-complete-workflow.js "Orlicron"
```

This single script will verify:
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Import session created and completed
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Journal entries created and balanced
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: General ledger entries created and balanced
- ‚úÖ Phase 5: Trial balance computation

### Step 4: UI Verification

After Claude confirms backend data is good, you check the UI:

1. **Reports ‚Üí Trial Balance**
   - Should show accounts with balances
   - Total debits should equal total credits

2. **Reports ‚Üí Balance Sheet**
   - Should show Assets = Liabilities + Equity
   - Numbers should match GL data

3. **Reports ‚Üí Income Statement**
   - Should show expenses if bank fees/charges imported
   - Operating expenses, bank charges, etc.

4. **Reports ‚Üí General Ledger (by Account)**
   - Select an account (e.g., "1000 - Current Assets")
   - Should see transaction details

5. **Reports ‚Üí Journal Entries**
   - Filter by source = "bank_import"
   - Should see all posted entries

### Step 5: Report Issues

If anything looks wrong:
- Take screenshots
- Describe the issue
- Share with Claude
- We'll debug together
