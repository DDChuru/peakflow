## What Was Implemented

### 1. Journal Source Type Extension

**File**: `/src/types/accounting/journal.ts`

Added `'opening_balance'` to the `JournalSource` type:

```typescript
export type JournalSource =
  | 'manual'
  | 'bank_import'
  | 'bank_transfer'
  | 'accounts_receivable'
  | 'accounts_payable'
  | 'accrual'
  | 'revaluation'
  | 'adjustment'
  | 'opening_balance';  // ← NEW
```

## How It Works

### User Workflow

```
1. Navigate to Setup → Opening Balances
2. Select fiscal period
3. Set effective date (typically period start date)
4. Enter balance for each account:
   - Assets/Expenses: Positive = Debit
   - Liabilities/Equity/Revenue: Positive = Credit
5. System auto-calculates Retained Earnings balancing entry
6. Preview journal entry
7. Post to ledger
8. Redirected to Journal to view entry
```

### Behind the Scenes

```
1. User enters balances
   ↓
2. Service validates inputs
   ↓
3. Calculates debits/credits based on account type
   ↓
4. Calculates balancing entry (Retained Earnings)
   ↓
5. Verifies total debits = total credits
   ↓
6. Creates journal entry:
   - source: 'opening_balance'
   - status: 'posted'
   - reference: 'OB-{fiscalPeriodId}'
   ↓
7. Creates GL entries (one per line)
   ↓
8. Batch write to Firestore (atomic)
   ↓
9. Success!
```

### Example: Orlicron October 4, 2024

**Input**:
```
Fiscal Period: 2024-10 (October 2024)
Effective Date: 2024-10-04

Accounts:
1000 Bank Account           R50,000.00
1100 Accounts Receivable    R75,000.00
1500 Equipment             R200,000.00
2000 Accounts Payable       R30,000.00
2500 Loan Payable          R100,000.00
```

**Resulting Journal Entry**:
```
Date: 2024-10-04
Reference: OB-2024-10
Source: opening_balance
Status: posted

DEBITS:
1000 Bank Account           R50,000.00
1100 Accounts Receivable    R75,000.00
1500 Equipment             R200,000.00
                           ──────────────
                           R325,000.00

CREDITS:
2000 Accounts Payable       R30,000.00
2500 Loan Payable          R100,000.00
3500 Retained Earnings     R195,000.00 ← AUTO-CALCULATED
                           ──────────────
                           R325,000.00

## Technical Features

### Account Type Logic

The service correctly handles double-entry accounting rules:

| Account Type | Positive Amount | Negative Amount |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Asset        | Debit          | Credit          |
| Expense      | Debit          | Credit          |
| Liability    | Credit         | Debit           |
| Equity       | Credit         | Debit           |
| Revenue      | Credit         | Debit           |

### Validation

- ✅ Prevents duplicate opening balances per fiscal period
- ✅ Validates account existence
- ✅ Ensures total debits = total credits
- ✅ Requires at least one account with non-zero balance
- ✅ Checks for duplicate account entries
- ✅ Validates numeric amounts

### Data Integrity

- ✅ Atomic batch writes (all or nothing)
- ✅ Journal entry ↔ GL entries linkage maintained
- ✅ Tenant isolation (all entries scoped to companyId)
- ✅ Fiscal period association
- ✅ Audit trail (createdBy, createdAt)

### Currency Support

- ✅ Reads company's default currency
- ✅ Formats amounts correctly (R for ZAR, $ for USD, € for EUR)
- ✅ Preserves decimal precision (2 decimal places)

## Security & Access Control

- ✅ Protected route: Requires `admin` or `financial_admin` role
- ✅ Company membership required
- ✅ Firestore rules apply (tenant isolation)

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Chart of accounts set up
   - At least one fiscal period created
   - Admin or Financial Admin role

2. **Steps**:
   - Go to: `/workspace/{companyId}/setup/opening-balances`
   - Select fiscal period
   - Enter balances for each account
   - Preview entry (optional)
   - Click "Post Opening Balances"

3. **Tips**:
   - Use positive amounts for normal balances
   - System auto-balances via Retained Earnings
   - Preview before posting
   - Can only post once per fiscal period

### For Developers:

```typescript
import { OpeningBalanceService } from '@/lib/accounting/opening-balance-service';

const service = new OpeningBalanceService(companyId);

const balances: OpeningBalanceInput[] = [
  {
    accountId: 'acc_bank',
    accountCode: '1000',
    accountName: 'Bank Account',
    accountType: 'asset',
    amount: 50000
  },
  // ... more accounts
];

const result = await service.postOpeningBalances(
  fiscalPeriodId,
  new Date('2024-10-04'),
  balances,
  retainedEarningsAccountId,
  userId,
  'ZAR'
);

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Posted! Journal Entry ID: ${result.journalEntryId}`);
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Import from CSV** - Allow bulk import of opening balances
2. **Trial Balance Import** - Import from old system's trial balance
3. **Fiscal Year Wizard** - Guided setup for new companies
4. **Opening Balance Adjustment** - Allow corrections after posting
5. **Multi-Currency Support** - Handle foreign currency opening balances
6. **Dimension Support** - Add department/project dimensions to opening balances
7. **Bank Reconciliation Link** - Auto-match opening bank balance with first reconciliation
8. **Customer/Supplier Balances** - Separate UI for AR/AP opening balances breakdown

## Known Limitations

1. **One Entry Per Period** - Can only create one opening balance entry per fiscal period
2. **No Edit After Post** - Cannot edit opening balances after posting (must delete and re-enter)
3. **Manual Deletion** - No UI to delete existing opening balance (must use Firestore Console)
4. **Single Retained Earnings** - Assumes one Retained Earnings account (3500 or first equity account)
5. **No Import** - No CSV/Excel import yet (manual entry only)

## Integration Points

### Works With:
- ✅ Chart of Accounts (loads accounts)
- ✅ Fiscal Periods (scope of entry)
- ✅ Journal Entries (creates entry)
- ✅ General Ledger (creates GL entries)
- ✅ Financial Reports (balances appear in reports)
- ✅ Bank Reconciliation (can use opening bank balance)

### Does NOT Yet Integrate With:
- ❌ Accounts Receivable breakdown (customer-level AR balances)
- ❌ Accounts Payable breakdown (supplier-level AP balances)
- ❌ Inventory breakdown (item-level inventory balances)

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common User Questions:

**Q: When should I enter opening balances?**
A: At the start of your first fiscal period in PeakFlow, or when migrating from another system.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**
A: Contact support to delete the entry, then re-enter. (Future: Add delete/edit UI)

**Q: Why is Retained Earnings auto-calculated?**
A: This ensures your books balance. It's the "plug" account that makes Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

**Q: Can I enter negative amounts?**
A: Yes, for contra accounts or adjustments.

**Q: What if I don't know my balances?**
A: Export a trial balance from your old system as of your go-live date.

### Common Technical Issues:

**Issue**: "Retained earnings account not found"
**Fix**: Create account code 3500 with type 'equity'

**Issue**: "Opening balance already exists"
**Fix**: Delete existing entry in Firestore or use different fiscal period

**Issue**: Build error after adding 'opening_balance' to JournalSource
**Fix**: Restart TypeScript server, rebuild
