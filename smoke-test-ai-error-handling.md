# üß™ Smoke Test: AI Error Handling Improvements

**Feature**: Graceful error handling for AI transaction analysis failures
**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Testing

---

## üìã What Was Fixed

Previously, when AI analysis failed (due to entity matching errors, API issues, or other problems), the system would crash with a **500 Internal Server Error**, providing no useful feedback to users.

Now, the system implements **graceful degradation** with user-friendly error messages at three layers:
- Service layer returns structured error responses
- API layer returns 200 with error flags
- Frontend displays helpful error messages

---

## üéØ Quick Verification (2 minutes)

### Test 1: Missing API Key Error
**Purpose**: Verify graceful handling when Anthropic API key is missing

1. **Temporarily remove API key**:
   - Open `.env.local`
   - Comment out or remove `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

2. **Trigger AI analysis**:
   - Navigate to Bank Import page
   - Click "Analyze with AI" on any transaction

3. **Expected Result**:
   - ‚úÖ Toast notification shows: "AI Assistant not configured. Please configure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY..."
   - ‚úÖ Console shows error details
   - ‚úÖ NO 500 error displayed
   - ‚úÖ User can continue working

4. **Restore API key** and restart server

---

### Test 2: Network/API Failure
**Purpose**: Verify handling when AI service fails

1. **Trigger analysis on complex transaction**:
   - Use a transaction with very long description (>1000 characters)
   - Or disconnect internet temporarily

2. **Expected Result**:
   - ‚úÖ Error message displayed in toast
   - ‚úÖ Message says: "I encountered an error analyzing this transaction. You can map it manually or try again."
   - ‚úÖ NO crash or 500 error
   - ‚úÖ Transaction remains available for manual mapping

---

### Test 3: Successful Analysis (Baseline)
**Purpose**: Ensure error handling doesn't break normal flow

1. **Analyze normal transaction**:
   - Use a transaction like "Payment from ABC Company - R5,000"
   - Click "Analyze with AI"

2. **Expected Result**:
   - ‚úÖ Green "Customer Recognized" badge shows (if entity matched)
   - ‚úÖ Blue AI suggestion card displays
   - ‚úÖ Toast shows: "AI analysis complete!"
   - ‚úÖ Debit/Credit accounts suggested correctly

---

## üîç Detailed Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Entity Matching Failure with AI Fallback
**Setup**:
1. Navigate to Bank Import: `/workspace/[companyId]/bank-import`
2. Select a bank statement with transactions
3. Go to "Needs AI" tab

**Steps**:
1. Click "Analyze with AI" on a transaction with generic description (e.g., "Transfer")
2. Observe the response

**Expected Results**:
- ‚ùå No entity match found (no green badge)
- ‚úÖ AI still suggests GL mapping based on description
- ‚úÖ Blue AI card shows suggestion with lower confidence (60-75%)
- ‚úÖ Toast notification: "AI analysis complete!"
- ‚úÖ User can accept suggestion or edit manually

**Common Issues to Check**:
- Transaction should remain in "Needs AI" tab if suggestion rejected
- Should be able to retry analysis
- Should be able to switch to manual mapping

---

### Scenario 2: Complete AI Service Failure
**Setup**:
1. Temporarily break the AI service (remove API key or disconnect internet)
2. Navigate to Bank Import page

**Steps**:
1. Click "Analyze with AI" on any transaction
2. Wait for response

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Error toast appears with message: "AI Assistant not configured" OR "I encountered an error analyzing this transaction..."
- ‚úÖ Console shows detailed error log with stack trace
- ‚úÖ HTTP response is 200 (not 500)
- ‚úÖ Response body includes:
  - `success: false`
  - `fallback: true`
  - `message: "..." (user-friendly error)`
  - `suggestion: null`
- ‚úÖ User can click "Manual Mapping" to continue working

**Common Issues to Check**:
- No infinite loading state
- No application crash
- Error is logged to console for debugging
- User can continue with other transactions

---

### Scenario 3: Partial Entity Match with Low Confidence
**Setup**:
1. Create customer: "ABC Company Ltd"
2. Import transaction: "Payment from XYZ Corp - R1,000" (non-matching customer)

**Steps**:
1. Click "Analyze with AI"
2. Observe entity matching results

**Expected Results**:
- ‚ùå No entity match found (confidence below 60% threshold)
- ‚úÖ AI still provides GL suggestion based on description
- ‚úÖ No green entity badge displayed
- ‚úÖ AI reasoning mentions: "No customer or supplier match found"
- ‚úÖ Suggestion confidence is moderate (60-80%)

---

### Scenario 4: Multiple Consecutive Failures
**Setup**:
1. Have API key missing or service unavailable
2. Queue of 5+ transactions needing AI analysis

**Steps**:
1. Click "Analyze with AI" on first transaction ‚Üí fails
2. Click "Next" to move to second transaction
3. Click "Analyze with AI" again ‚Üí fails
4. Repeat for third transaction

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Each failure shows error toast
- ‚úÖ User can continue through all transactions
- ‚úÖ No accumulated errors or crashes
- ‚úÖ UI remains responsive
- ‚úÖ Console shows all error logs for debugging

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Verification

### Check Console Logs

When AI analysis fails, console should show:
```
[AI Assistant] Error: [error details]
[AI API] Error: [error details]
[AI API] Error stack: [full stack trace]
[AI] Analysis failed: [user-friendly message]
```

### Check Network Response

Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab:
1. Click "Analyze with AI"
2. Check the `analyze-transaction` request

**Successful case**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Here's my analysis...",
  "suggestion": { /* mapping details */ },
  "createAccount": null,
  "needsMoreInfo": false
}
```

**Failure case**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "AI analysis failed",
  "message": "I encountered an error analyzing this transaction. You can map it manually or try again.",
  "details": "Anthropic API key not found",
  "fallback": true,
  "suggestion": null,
  "createAccount": null,
  "needsMoreInfo": false
}
```

**Critical**: Status code should be **200** (not 500) in both cases.
