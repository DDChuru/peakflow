# Bank Import Posting Fix - Missing accountName Field

## Root Cause Identified ✅

The posting failures were caused by **missing `accountName` field** in journal entries.

---

## The Problem

### Error Pattern
```
Failed to process transaction V3DSdirirslKNwLvsb7F… in document general_ledger/046Rry4GgoQvAZC04Gjl
Failed to process transaction V3DSdirirslKNwLvsb7F… in document general_ledger/1ocYVKM17EJt70dex9YM
... (27 more similar errors)
```

### Why the Same Transaction ID Appeared Multiple Times
- One bank transaction creates ONE journal entry
- Each journal entry has TWO lines (debit and credit - double-entry accounting)
- Each journal line becomes ONE ledger entry
- So one bank transaction → 2 ledger entry writes
- If 27 writes failed, approximately 13-14 bank transactions were affected

---

## Technical Analysis

### Type Requirements

**`JournalLine` interface** (src/types/accounting/journal.ts:12-23):
```typescript
export interface JournalLine {
  id: string;
  accountId: string;
  accountCode: string;
  accountName: string;  // ❌ REQUIRED - not optional!
  description?: string;
  debit: number;
  credit: number;
  currency: string;
  // ...
}
```

**`LedgerEntry` interface** (src/types/accounting/general-ledger.ts:1-21):
```typescript
export interface LedgerEntry {
  id: string;
  tenantId: string;
  journalEntryId: string;
  journalLineId: string;
  accountId: string;
  accountCode: string;
  accountName: string;  // ❌ REQUIRED - not optional!
  description?: string;
  debit: number;
  credit: number;
  // ...
}
```

Both types **require** `accountName` as a non-optional field.

---

### The Bug

**File**: `src/lib/accounting/bank-to-ledger-service.ts`

**Lines 444-461** (BEFORE FIX):
```typescript
// Money coming into bank - debit bank, credit revenue/liability
lines.push({
  id: `${bankTransaction.id}_debit`,
  accountId: mapping.debitAccountId,
  accountCode: mapping.debitAccountCode,
  description: mapping.description || bankTransaction.description,
  debit: amount,
  credit: 0,
  currency,
  // ❌ accountName is MISSING!
});
```

**The Flow of the Bug:**
1. `createJournalEntry()` creates journal lines WITHOUT `accountName`
2. `PostingService.post()` tries to copy `accountName` from journal lines (posting-service.ts:79)
3. `accountName` is `undefined`
4. Firestore rejects the write because `accountName` is required
5. ALL transactions fail with the same error

---

## The Fix ✅

**File**: `src/lib/accounting/bank-to-ledger-service.ts`

### Added Account Lookup (lines 437-446):
```typescript
// Fetch account names for the accounts being used
const debitAccount = await this.coaService.getAccount(mapping.debitAccountId);
const creditAccount = await this.coaService.getAccount(mapping.creditAccountId);

if (!debitAccount) {
  throw new Error(`Debit account not found: ${mapping.debitAccountId} (${mapping.debitAccountCode})`);
}
if (!creditAccount) {
  throw new Error(`Credit account not found: ${mapping.creditAccountId} (${mapping.creditAccountCode})`);
}
```

### Added accountName to Journal Lines (lines 459, 469, 481, 491):
```typescript
// Deposit example
lines.push({
  id: `${bankTransaction.id}_debit`,
  accountId: mapping.debitAccountId,
  accountCode: mapping.debitAccountCode,
  accountName: debitAccount.name,  // ✅ FIXED!
  description: mapping.description || bankTransaction.description,
  debit: amount,
  credit: 0,
  currency,
});
lines.push({
  id: `${bankTransaction.id}_credit`,
  accountId: mapping.creditAccountId,
  accountCode: mapping.creditAccountCode,
  accountName: creditAccount.name,  // ✅ FIXED!
  description: mapping.description || bankTransaction.description,
  debit: 0,
  credit: amount,
  currency,
});
```

---

## Additional Benefits of This Fix

1. **Better Error Messages**: If an account doesn't exist, you now get a clear error:
   ```
   Debit account not found: abc123 (1000)
   ```
   Instead of a cryptic Firestore write error.

2. **Data Integrity**: Ensures all journal entries have valid accounts before attempting to post.

3. **Account Name Display**: Ledger entries now properly display account names in the UI.

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Bank Import Posting

**Steps:**
1. Go to Workspace → Bank Import
2. Select a bank statement
3. Map transactions (auto-mapped, manual, or AI)
4. Select transactions to post
5. Click "Post to Ledger"

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Transactions post successfully
- ✅ Success toast: "Posted X transactions to the general ledger"
- ✅ No more "Failed to process transaction" errors

### 3. Verify in Firestore

**Collection**: `general_ledger`

**Check recent entries:**
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "accountId": "...",
  "accountCode": "1000",
  "accountName": "Bank Account",  // ✅ Should be present!
  "debit": 5000,
  "credit": 0,
  "description": "Bank import: Payment received",
  "currency": "ZAR",
  "transactionDate": "2024-12-03T...",
  "fiscalPeriodId": "2024-12"
}
```

### 4. Check Console Logs

**Should see:**
```
[BankToLedger] Using company currency: ZAR
[PostToLedger] Transaction dates: [
  { id: "...", date: "2024-12-03", description: "..." }
]
✅ Posted 27 transactions to the general ledger
```

**Should NOT see:**
```
❌ Failed to process transaction V3DSdirirslKNwLvsb7F...
```

## What About the 2001 Date Issue?

This is a **separate issue** - the date parsing problem where 19/12/01 is parsed as 2001 instead of 2024.

**Status**: Still needs investigation
- Enhanced logging is in place
- Need to check console output to see actual transaction dates
- May need to fix date parsing in bank statement extraction

**Important**: The fiscal period warning for 2001 dates is just a warning - it doesn't prevent posting. The real issue was the missing accountName field.

---

## Errors You Might Still See (And What They Mean)

### 1. Account Not Found
```
Error: Debit account not found: abc123 (1000)
```
**Cause**: The mapped GL account doesn't exist in the chart of accounts
**Fix**: Create the account or fix the mapping

### 2. Fiscal Period Not Open
```
Error: Fiscal period is not open
```
**Cause**: Trying to post to a closed/locked fiscal period
**Fix**: Reopen the period or post to a different period

### 3. Unbalanced Entry
```
Error: Cannot post unbalanced journal entry
```
**Cause**: Debits ≠ Credits (should never happen with bank imports)
**Fix**: Bug in amount calculation - needs investigation

### 4. Firestore Permissions
```
FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions
```
**Cause**: Firestore rules not deployed
**Fix**: Run `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

## Files Modified

| File | Lines Changed | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `src/lib/accounting/bank-to-ledger-service.ts` | 437-446, 459, 469, 481, 491 | Added account lookup and accountName to journal lines |

---

## Summary

✅ **Root cause identified**: Missing required `accountName` field in journal entries
✅ **Fix implemented**: Fetch account names from chart of accounts before creating journal entries
✅ **Validation added**: Error if debit/credit accounts don't exist
✅ **Ready to test**: Restart dev server and retry posting

**Next Steps**:
1. Restart dev server
2. Retry posting bank transactions
3. Verify transactions appear in general_ledger with accountName populated
4. If successful, investigate the 2001 date issue separately
