# Smoke Test: Quote Edit Functionality Fix

## Summary of Fix

### Root Cause
The Edit Dialog component was **completely missing** from the JSX markup, even though:
- `isEditDialogOpen` state was declared
- `openEditDialog()` function existed and was called
- `handleEdit()` submit handler existed
- Edit button in dropdown menu was functional

**Result**: Silent failure - clicking Edit did nothing because there was no dialog to render.

### What Was Fixed

1. **Added Edit Dialog Component** (lines 1014-1251 in page.tsx)
   - Complete form dialog matching Create Dialog structure
   - Form fields: Customer, Quote Date, Validity Period, Currency, Tax Rate, Notes, Terms
   - Line items management with add/remove functionality
   - Real-time subtotal, tax, and total calculations
   - Proper submit handler integration with `handleEdit()`

2. **Enhanced Debug Logging in `openEditDialog()`** (lines 442-469)
   - Logs when dialog opens
   - Logs quote data being loaded
   - Logs form line items initialization
   - Tracks state changes

3. **Enhanced Debug Logging in `handleEdit()`** (lines 305-390)
   - Validates user authentication
   - Validates quote selection
   - Logs validation steps
   - Tracks Firestore update calls
   - Logs success/failure with detailed errors
   - Tracks list refresh

4. **Enhanced Debug Logging in Service Layer** (quote-service.ts lines 300-385)
   - Logs service method calls
   - Tracks amount calculations
   - Logs Firestore path and operations
   - Detailed error reporting

## Success Criteria

## If Tests Fail

### Edit Dialog Doesn't Open
- Check console for errors
- Verify `isEditDialogOpen` state (React DevTools)
- Check if Edit Dialog component is rendered in JSX

### Form Not Pre-filled
- Check console logs in `openEditDialog()`
- Verify `setValue()` calls are executing
- Check if `selectedQuote` has correct data

### Submit Does Nothing
- Check console for validation errors
- Verify `handleEdit()` is being called
- Check network tab for Firestore request

### Firestore Update Fails
- Check Firestore rules for permissions
- Verify user has access to company
- Check console for detailed error logs
- Verify quote ID and company ID are correct
