# Main Branch Context - Modernization Roadmap

## Purpose
This is the main development branch following the comprehensive modernization roadmap outlined in `/current-prompt.md` and tracked in `/project-management/modernization-roadmap.md`.

   ```
2. **Test Industry Selection** - During company onboarding
3. **Validate Pattern Matching** - With real bank data
4. **Fine-tune Confidence Scores** - Based on usage

### Remaining Phase 5 Tasks
1. **Industry Template UI Integration** (Next Priority)
   - Company onboarding with template selection
   - Template preview and customization
2. **Cash flow forecasting** (model exists, needs UI)
3. **Transfer workflows between accounts**
4. **Reconciliation reports and export**
5. **Period locks after reconciliation**

## Upcoming Phases
1. **Phase 6 – Managed Accounts Features**
   - Extend GL access, trading accounts, and reporting for manageAccounts tenants.
2. **Phase 7 – Document Management System**
   - Implement the document repository, enhanced PDF extraction, and annotation tooling.
3. **Phase 8 – Financial Dashboard Evolution**
   - Deliver configurable widgets, advanced KPIs, and operational metrics.
4. **Phase 9 – Reporting & Analytics**
   - Build the report engine, financial packs, and custom report builder ahead of launch.

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **Multi-tenant:** Company-scoped collections (CSC) pattern
- **Service Layer:** Singleton services for all Firebase operations
- **State Management:** React Context for auth, local state for components
- **Validation:** Zod schemas with React Hook Form
- **UI Framework:** Tailwind CSS v4 with Radix UI primitives
- **Industry Templates:** Firestore-persisted with indexing for performance
- **Pattern Matching:** Regex-based with confidence scoring

## Development Guidelines
1. **Always update** `/project-management/modernization-roadmap.md` after completing features
2. **Follow CSC pattern** for new collections: `/companies/{companyId}/collection`
3. **Use existing services** from `/src/lib/firebase/` and `/src/lib/accounting/`
4. **Maintain type safety** with TypeScript strict mode
5. **Create smoke tests** for all new features in `/project-management/smoke-test/`
6. **Seed templates** before testing: `npm run seed:industry-templates`

## Critical Next Steps
1. Complete remaining Phase 5 items (focus on UI for templates)
2. Test industry templates with real data
3. Begin Phase 6 planning for managed accounts features
4. Implement comprehensive testing suite
5. Document API endpoints for external integrations
6. Prepare for production deployment

## Performance Targets
- Initial page load: < 3s
- Subsequent navigation: < 1s
- Firebase queries: < 500ms
- PDF processing: < 5s for 10 pages
- Auto-match algorithm: < 2s for 100 transactions
- Pattern matching: < 100ms per transaction
- Template application: < 2 seconds

## Security Requirements
- Role-based access control (RBAC) fully enforced
- Company data isolation verified
- API keys stored securely in Firebase config
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Audit trail for all financial operations

## Testing Strategy
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Integration testing for service layer
- E2E testing with Playwright
- Manual smoke tests for critical paths
- Performance testing with Lighthouse

## Deployment Pipeline
- Development: Local with `npm run dev`
- Staging: Vercel preview deployments
- Production: Vercel production deployment
- Functions: Firebase Functions deployment
- Database: Firestore with security rules

## Support & Documentation
- Technical docs in `/docs` (to be created)
- User guides in `/guides` (to be created)
- API documentation with OpenAPI spec
- Video tutorials for key workflows
