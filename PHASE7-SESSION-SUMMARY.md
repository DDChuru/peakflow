### Part 3: Phase 6 Integration (Complete!)

**File Modified**:
- `/src/lib/accounting/payment-allocation-service.ts`

**Integration Details**:
```typescript
// OLD (Phase 6 placeholder):
async handleOverPayment(...) {
  // TODO: Phase 7 - create credit note
  return { message: "Will create credit note in Phase 7" }
}

// NEW (Phase 7 integrated):
async handleOverPayment(...) {
  // 1. Pay invoice in full
  await runTransaction(...mark invoice as paid...)

  // 2. Create credit note for excess
  const creditNoteService = createCreditNoteService(...)
  const creditNoteResult = await creditNoteService.createCreditNoteFromOverPayment({
    customerId: invoice.debtorId,
    excessAmount,
    ...
  })

  // 3. Return with credit note ID
  return {
    message: "Invoice paid + credit note created",
    creditNoteId: creditNoteResult.creditNoteId
  }
}
```

**What This Means**:
- When AI detects an over-payment and user approves
- Invoice is marked as **paid**
- Excess amount automatically creates a **credit note**
- Credit note is **approved and posted to GL**
- Customer has **credit balance** for future use
- All happens **automatically** - zero manual steps!
