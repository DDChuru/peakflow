## Data Validation Tests

- ✅ Optional fields only included if they have values
- ✅ All required fields present

- ✅ Status breakdowns accurate
- ✅ Real-time updates when data changes

## Performance Tests

### Test: Search Responsiveness

2. Use search functionality
3. Type quickly and observe results

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Search results update in real-time
- ✅ No lag or freezing
- ✅ Filters apply instantly

### Test: Form Validation
1. Try to submit forms with missing required fields
2. Enter invalid data (negative numbers, etc.)

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Validation errors show immediately
- ✅ Submit button disabled when invalid
- ✅ Error messages clear and helpful
- ✅ Zod schema validation works

---

## Common Issues Checklist

### ❌ Issue: "Unsupported field value: undefined"
**Cause:** Optional field sent as undefined to Firestore
**Fix:** Already implemented - conditional field inclusion pattern
**Verify:** Check that optional fields only added when they have values

### ❌ Issue: Line items not calculating
**Cause:** Quantity or unitPrice not updating
**Fix:** Auto-calculation in updateLineItem function
**Verify:** Change quantity or unit price, amount updates immediately

### ❌ Issue: GL Account dropdown empty
**Cause:** No revenue accounts in Chart of Accounts
**Fix:** Create revenue accounts first
**Verify:** Chart of Accounts has accounts with type="revenue"

### ❌ Issue: Customer dropdown empty
**Cause:** No customers (debtors) created
**Fix:** Create customers first in Customers module
**Verify:** At least one active customer exists

---
