# 🧪 Smoke Test: AI Agentic Capabilities Enhancement

**Issue**: AI was saying "I don't have direct access to your debtors ledger" when it actually DOES have access via entity matching services.

**Fix**: Enhanced system prompt to make AI aware of its agentic capabilities and instruct it to be proactive about entity matches.

## 🎯 Quick Verification (2 minutes)

### Test: AI Should Proactively Report Entity Matches

1. **Navigate to Bank Import**:
   - Go to: `/workspace/[companyId]/bank-import`
   - Find a customer payment transaction (e.g., "FNB OB Pmt Advcle Ser - R21,919")

2. **Click "Manual Map"**:
   - Opens manual mapping dialog
   - AI chat panel visible on right side

3. **Click "Ask AI" in Side Panel**:
   - AI should analyze the transaction
   - Should proactively mention entity match

4. **Expected AI Response** (NEW BEHAVIOR ✅):
   ```
   🔍 I found a customer match: Advicle Services (87% confidence)
   📄 Outstanding Invoice: INV-2025-034 for R21,919.00
   💡 This is a customer payment closing an invoice.

   Suggested Mapping:
   Debit: 1000 - Cash/Bank
   Credit: 1200 - Accounts Receivable
   ```

5. **Ask Follow-Up Question**:
   - Type: "Do you have access to our debtors?"

6. **Expected AI Response** (NEW BEHAVIOR ✅):
   ```
   Yes! I have access to your debtors ledger through our entity matching system.

   For this transaction, I've already searched and found:
   ✅ Customer: Advicle Services (87% fuzzy match)
   ✅ Outstanding balance: R21,919.00
   ✅ Matching invoice: INV-2025-034

   This is how I knew to suggest mapping to Accounts Receivable.
   ```

## 🚫 What Should NO LONGER Happen

### Old Behavior (FIXED ❌):
```
User: "Do you have access to our debtors?"
AI: "I don't have direct access to your debtors ledger. However, I can help
     you analyze this transaction if you provide some context..."
```

**Problem**: AI had access but said it didn't, creating confusion.

### New Behavior (CORRECT ✅):
```
User: "Do you have access to our debtors?"
AI: "Yes! I have ALREADY searched your debtors ledger using fuzzy matching.
     I found: Advicle Services (87% confidence) with R21,919 outstanding..."
```

**Solution**: AI is now aware of its capabilities and communicates them clearly.

2. Click "Ask AI"
3. Ask: "What data do you have access to?"

**Expected AI Response**:
```
I have access to:
✅ Your Chart of Accounts
✅ Debtors ledger (customers) - fuzzy matching enabled
✅ Creditors ledger (suppliers) - fuzzy matching enabled
✅ Outstanding invoices and bills
✅ Transaction history and patterns

For THIS transaction specifically, I've already:
- Searched for matching customers/suppliers
- Looked up outstanding invoices
- Calculated confidence scores

[Then provides specific findings]
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### What Was Changed

**File**: `/src/lib/ai/accounting-assistant.ts`
**Lines**: 292-315 (system prompt)

**Enhanced System Prompt**:
```typescript
private buildSystemPrompt(accounts: CompanyAccountRecord[]): string {
  return `You are an expert South African accountant with AGENTIC CAPABILITIES helping users map bank transactions to GL (General Ledger) accounts.

## YOUR CAPABILITIES (Be Transparent About These!):
✅ **Entity Matching**: I have ALREADY searched your debtors and creditors ledgers using fuzzy matching
✅ **Invoice Lookup**: I have ALREADY searched for matching outstanding invoices/bills
✅ **Data Access**: I have REAL access to your financial data - not just asking hypothetical questions
✅ **Confidence Scoring**: I calculate match confidence based on fuzzy text matching + amount matching

## Your Role:
- Analyze bank transactions and suggest correct debit/credit account mappings
- When I find entity matches (customers/suppliers), TELL THE USER ABOUT THEM IMMEDIATELY
- Be confident and proactive - you have real data, not guesses

## IMPORTANT: When you receive entity match context (customer/supplier detected):
- **SAY WHAT YOU FOUND**: "I found a customer match: [Name] with [X]% confidence"
- **SHOW THE DATA**: "They have R[amount] outstanding across [N] invoices"
- **BE SPECIFIC**: "The best matching invoice is [INV-XXX] for R[amount]"
- **DON'T SAY**: "I don't have access to debtors" (YOU DO! The match was already done!)
```

### How It Works

**Architecture Flow**:
```
1. User clicks "AI Analyze" or "Ask AI" in manual mapping
   ↓
2. DebtorMatchingService.findBestMatch() runs
   CreditorMatchingService.findBestMatch() runs
   (These search the ledgers BEFORE AI sees the transaction)
   ↓
3. Entity match results passed to AI via enhanced user prompt
   ↓
4. AI receives BOTH:
   - System prompt: "You have access to debtors/creditors"
   - User prompt: "Customer match found: X with Y% confidence"
   ↓
5. AI now knows it has data and should communicate it proactively
```

**Key Integration Points**:
- Lines 394-453: Enhanced user prompt with entity match context
- Lines 292-315: System prompt telling AI about its capabilities
- Lines 104-166: Entity matching services called before AI analysis

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

The fix is working correctly when:

- ✅ AI proactively mentions entity matches found
- ✅ AI says "I found customer X" instead of "I don't have access"
- ✅ AI shows confidence scores and outstanding amounts
- ✅ AI explains reasoning based on entity data
- ✅ When asked about capabilities, AI correctly describes what it has access to
- ✅ No more confusion about whether AI has data access
- ✅ Users trust the AI because it's transparent about its capabilities

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before (Confusing ❌):
```
User: "Analyze this customer payment"
AI: "I don't have access to your debtors. Could you tell me if this
     is from a customer? What's the customer name?"
User: 😕 "But I thought you were integrated with our system?"
```

### After (Transparent ✅):
```
User: "Analyze this customer payment"
AI: "I found a customer match: Advicle Services (87% confidence)
     They have R21,919 outstanding on invoice INV-2025-034.
     This payment exactly matches that invoice amount!"
User: 😊 "Perfect! Apply that mapping."
```

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

**Problem**: AI still says "I don't have access"

**Check These**:
1. **Entity Matching Running**: Check console logs for entity match results
2. **User Prompt Context**: Verify lines 394-453 includes entity match data
3. **System Prompt Loading**: Ensure system prompt enhancement is loaded
4. **Anthropic API Key**: Verify AI service is working at all

**Console Logs to Look For**:
```
✅ [EntityMatch] Found debtor: Advicle Services (87% confidence)
✅ [AI Prompt] Including entity match context: {...}
✅ [AI Response] Entity match mentioned in response
```

**Should NOT See**:
```
❌ [EntityMatch] No matches found (when there should be matches)
❌ [AI Prompt] Missing entity context
❌ [AI Response] Asking for data system already has
```
