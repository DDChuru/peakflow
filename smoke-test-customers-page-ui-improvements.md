# Smoke Test: Customers Page UI/UX Improvements

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step verification procedures for the enhanced Customers page UI/UX improvements at `/app/workspace/[companyId]/customers/page.tsx`.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Scrollable Table Container with Fixed Height
- Table now uses remaining viewport height: `h-[calc(100vh-28rem)]`
- Vertical scrolling enabled when customers exceed visible area
- Sticky table header that remains visible while scrolling
- Smooth scroll behavior

### 2. Fixed Dropdown Menu Positioning
- Viewport boundary detection to prevent cutoff
- Automatically positions menu above trigger if it would overflow bottom
- Menu aligns to the right by default
- Proper z-index layering

### 3. Enhanced Loading States
- Comprehensive skeleton UI for all page sections
- Separate loading states for access check vs data loading
- Smooth transitions between states

### 4. Improved User Experience
- Click customer name to view details (not entire row)
- Hover effects on rows and interactive elements
- Truncated long email addresses with tooltips
- Results counter showing filtered/total customers
- Keyboard shortcuts (⌘K for search, ⌘N for new customer)
- Scroll indicator with animated arrow
- Visual hierarchy improvements

### 5. Better Visual Design
- Sticky header with subtle shadow
- Consistent spacing and padding
- Better border and divider usage
- Improved color contrast
- Professional hover states

## Test Procedures

### Test 1: Scrollable Table Container
**Objective**: Verify the table container uses available height and scrolls properly

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/workspace/[companyId]/customers`
2. Wait for the page to fully load
3. Observe the Customer Directory table

**Expected Results**:
- Table takes up most of the remaining viewport height
- If there are many customers (more than fit on screen), a scrollbar appears
- The table header with column names is visible
- Scrolling works smoothly

**Common Issues to Check**:
- Table should NOT show only 1-2 rows with lots of empty space below
- Scrollbar should appear on the right side of the table when needed
- Page should not have double scrollbars (one for page, one for table)

### Test 2: Sticky Table Header
**Objective**: Verify table header remains visible while scrolling

**Prerequisites**: Need at least 15+ customers to enable scrolling

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to customers page with many customers

**Solution**: Ensure CardContent has `overflow-hidden` and inner div has `overflow-auto`

### Issue: Dropdown Gets Cut Off
**Solution**: Verify dropdown-menu.tsx has viewport boundary detection logic

### Issue: Header Doesn't Stay Fixed
**Solution**: Check thead has `sticky top-0 bg-white z-10` classes

### Issue: Skeleton Doesn't Match Layout
**Solution**: Ensure skeleton structure matches the actual content structure

### Issue: Search Shortcut Opens Browser Search
**Solution**: Verify `e.preventDefault()` is called in keyboard event handler

## Performance Notes

## Next Steps

After verifying all tests pass:

3. Get user feedback on new interactions
4. Consider adding pagination if needed
5. Consider adding column sorting
6. Consider adding bulk actions
