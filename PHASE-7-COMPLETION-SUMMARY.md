## ❌ What's Missing (15%)

### 1. StatementService.getStatements() Method
**Priority:** HIGH
**Impact:** Customer statements page shows empty list because it can't load saved statements

**Required:**
```typescript
async getStatements(
  filters?: StatementQueryFilters
): Promise<Statement[]>
```

**What it needs to do:**
- Query `companies/{companyId}/statements` collection
- Filter by date range, customer, status
- Convert Firestore timestamps
- Sort by date descending
- Return array of Statement objects

### 2. Email Integration
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Email button exists but doesn't send emails

**Required:**
- Email service integration (SendGrid/AWS SES)
- Email templates for statements
- Attachment handling for PDFs
- Email tracking (sent status)

**Current State:**
- Button exists in UI
- No actual email sending functionality

### 3. Supplier Statements UI
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Only customer statements have UI, suppliers need same capability

**Required:**
- Duplicate `/statements/page.tsx` for suppliers
- Change `debtors` to `creditors`
- Change API calls from `debtor-service` to `creditor-service`
- Update terminology (customer → supplier, receivable → payable)

**Current State:**
- Service layer supports supplier statements
- No UI page for suppliers
- Creditors list available in `/suppliers` page

### 4. Statement Persistence
**Priority:** HIGH
**Impact:** Generated statements aren't being saved to Firestore

**Current State:**
- Statement generation creates in-memory objects
- PDF generation works
- But statements not saved to `companies/{companyId}/statements` collection
- Therefore `getStatements()` would return empty even if implemented

**Required:**
- Save statement to Firestore after generation
- Update statement status (draft → finalized → sent)
- Track sent date, viewed date
- Store PDF URL if uploaded to Storage

## 🎯 To Reach 100% Complete

### Quick Wins (Can Complete in 1-2 Hours):

1. **Implement `getStatements()` Method** (30 mins)
   - Add to `statement-service.ts`
   - Query Firestore collection
   - Return statements array

2. **Add Statement Persistence** (30 mins)
   - Save to Firestore after generation
   - Update UI to use saved statements

3. **Create Supplier Statements UI** (45 mins)
   - Copy customer statements page
   - Swap debtor → creditor references
   - Test with supplier data

### Future Enhancements (Can Defer):

4. **Email Integration** (2-3 hours)
   - Requires email service setup
   - Template creation
   - Can be added in next phase

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Add `getStatements()` to StatementService ✅
```typescript
async getStatements(filters?: {
  customerIds?: string[];
  status?: StatementStatus[];
  dateFrom?: Date;
  dateTo?: Date;
}): Promise<Statement[]> {
  const statementsRef = collection(
    db,
    'companies',
    this.companyId,
    'statements'
  );

  let q = query(statementsRef, orderBy('createdAt', 'desc'));

  // Apply filters...

  const snapshot = await getDocs(q);
  return snapshot.docs.map(doc => this.convertFirestoreStatement(doc.data()));
}
```

### Step 2: Save Statements After Generation ✅
Update `generateCustomerStatement()` to save:
```typescript
// After building statement object
const statementRef = doc(
  db,
  'companies',
  this.companyId,
  'statements',
  statement.id
);

await setDoc(statementRef, {
  ...statement,
  createdAt: Timestamp.now(),
  updatedAt: Timestamp.now(),
});
```

### Step 3: Create Supplier Statements Page ✅
- Copy `/statements/page.tsx` → `/supplier-statements/page.tsx`
- Update imports and API calls
- Change terminology

## Firestore Schema

### Collection: `companies/{companyId}/statements`

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  type: 'customer' | 'supplier';
  entityId: string;  // customerId or supplierId
  entityName: string;
  periodStart: Timestamp;
  periodEnd: Timestamp;
  openingBalance: number;
  closingBalance: number;
  status: 'draft' | 'finalized' | 'sent' | 'viewed' | 'archived';
  agedAnalysis: {
    current: number;
    thirtyDays: number;
    sixtyDays: number;
    ninetyDays: number;
    oneTwentyPlus: number;
    total: number;
  };
  summary: {
    openingBalance: number;
    totalInvoices: number;
    totalPayments: number;
    totalCredits: number;
    closingBalance: number;
    invoiceCount: number;
    paymentCount: number;
    creditNoteCount: number;
  };
  transactions: Array<{
    date: Timestamp;
    type: string;
    reference: string;
    description: string;
    debit: number;
    credit: number;
    runningBalance: number;
  }>;
  pdfUrl?: string;  // Firebase Storage URL if uploaded
  sentAt?: Timestamp;
  sentTo?: string[];  // Email addresses
  viewedAt?: Timestamp;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
  createdBy: string;  // userId
}
```

## Conclusion

Phase 7 is **85% complete** with excellent UI and service layer foundation. To reach **100%**:

1. ✅ Add `getStatements()` method (30 mins)
2. ✅ Save statements to Firestore (30 mins)
3. ✅ Create supplier statements UI (45 mins)

**Total time to completion: ~2 hours**

Email integration can be deferred to a future phase as it requires external service setup.
