# Financial Reports Investigation - Summary

## Investigation Date
2025-10-20

## Question Asked
Do financial reports (trial balance, balance sheet, P&L, income statement, cash flow, etc.) have their own Firestore collections/stored data, or are they purely computed/generated on-the-fly from general ledger and journal entries?

---

## Critical Finding

**ANSWER: Reports are PURELY COMPUTED on-the-fly. NO Firestore collections store report data.**

This means when you delete ledger entries, all reports automatically reflect those deletions with zero additional cleanup needed.

---

## Investigation Scope

### 1. Report Components & Pages Examined
- **Location**: `/app/workspace/[companyId]/reports/page.tsx` (40k+ tokens)
- **Finding**: Client-side component that calls report services, displays results temporarily
- **Storage**: Nothing persisted to Firestore

### 2. Report Services Analyzed
All three reporting services examined in detail:

#### GL Reports Service (`/src/lib/reporting/gl-reports-service.ts`)
- Trial Balance Report - COMPUTED
- General Ledger by Account Report - COMPUTED
- Journal Entries Report - COMPUTED
- **All methods**: Read from Firestore, compute in-memory, return (no writes)

#### Financial Statements Service (`/src/lib/reporting/financial-statements-service.ts`)
- Income Statement (P&L) - COMPUTED
- Balance Sheet - COMPUTED
- Cash Flow Statement - COMPUTED
- **All methods**: Query general_ledger, compute aggregates, return (no writes)

#### AP/AR Reports Service (`/src/lib/reporting/ap-ar-reports-service.ts`)
- Aged Receivables Report - COMPUTED
- Aged Payables Report - COMPUTED
- AR Summary by Customer - COMPUTED
- AP Summary by Vendor - COMPUTED
- **All methods**: Query invoices/vendorBills, aggregate, return (no writes)

### 3. Data Sources Verified
- general_ledger (source data, read-only)
- journal_entries (source data, read-only)
- accounting_accounts (metadata, read-only)
- companies/{companyId}/invoices (source for AR reports)
- companies/{companyId}/vendorBills (source for AP reports)

### 4. Firestore Schema Checked
- Reviewed entire `firestore.rules` file (660 lines)
- Found NO report collection definitions
- Found NO report storage patterns
- Confirmed these collections do NOT exist:
  - `reports`
  - `trial_balance`
  - `balance_sheet`
  - `income_statements`
  - `cash_flow_statements`
  - `financial_reports`
  - `report_cache`
  - `report_snapshots`
  - `report_archives`
  - `account_balances`

### 5. Fiscal Periods Examined
- Checked `/src/types/accounting/fiscal-period.ts`
- Fiscal periods store metadata ONLY (dates, names, status)
- NO balance storage
- NO snapshot storage
- NO aggregated account data

### 6. API Endpoints Verified
- Searched `/app/api/` directory
- No report storage endpoints found
- Only AI utilities present
- Reports are purely client-computed

## Key Architecture Insight

### Report Generation Pattern

Every report service follows this pattern:

```
Query Firestore (general_ledger, invoices, etc.)
       ↓
Compute aggregates in memory
       ↓
Return result object
       ↓
Display in UI
       ↓
Object destroyed when user navigates
(NOTHING persisted to Firestore)
```

### Zero Persistence

- No `.setDoc()` or `.updateDoc()` calls in any report service
- No writes to Firestore collections
- All computation is transient
- Report objects exist only in browser RAM

---

## Data Deletion Scope (Definitive)

### What To Delete
```
DELETE ONLY:
├── general_ledger entries (if needed)
└── journal_entries (if needed)

NOTHING ELSE NEEDED:
├── No report collections to clean
├── No caches to invalidate
├── No snapshots to purge
├── No archives to remove
└── No balance tables to reset
```

### Automatic Effects
```
When you delete general_ledger entries:
✅ Trial balance automatically reflects change
✅ Balance sheet automatically reflects change
✅ Income statement automatically reflects change
✅ Cash flow statement automatically reflects change
✅ GL account reports automatically reflect change
✅ All reports stay in sync with ledger
✅ No stale data risk
```

## Verification Method

### Systematic Approach
1. **File Search**: Used Glob patterns to find all report files
2. **Content Search**: Grep for report collection references
3. **Schema Review**: Checked firestore.rules for all collection definitions
4. **Source Analysis**: Read full service implementations
5. **Type Verification**: Checked type definitions for storage hints
6. **API Audit**: Verified no report storage endpoints exist

### Search Patterns Used
- `**/reports/**`
- `**/financial-reports/**`
- `**/*balance-sheet*`
- `**/*trial-balance*`
- `**/*income-statement*`
- `**/*cash-flow*`
- `collection(db, '*report*')`
- `saveReport|storeReport|archiveReport|cacheReport`
- Regex patterns for Firestore collection definitions

### Confirmations
- Verified NO report storage in firestore.rules
- Verified NO write operations in report services
- Verified NO API endpoints for report storage
- Verified NO fiscal period balance caching
- Verified NO nested collections for reports

## Impact Assessment

### Data Deletion Scenario

**Scenario**: User needs to delete journal entries due to error

**Current State**:
```
1. Delete from journal_entries collection
2. Reports automatically reflect deletion
3. End result: All reports stay consistent
```

**Overhead**: ZERO additional cleanup

**Risk**: NONE (no stale report data)

### System Consistency

**Reports are ALWAYS current** because:
1. No caching layer
2. No stored snapshots
3. No aggregated balances
4. Every report generated fresh
5. Query from source of truth (ledger)

---

## Conclusion

### The Simple Answer

**Q: Do financial reports store their own data in Firestore?**
**A: NO.**

**Q: Do I need to clean up report data when deleting ledger entries?**
**A: NO.**

**Q: Are reports always current?**
**A: YES - they're computed on-the-fly.**

### Implementation Quality

The architecture is **excellent** for this use case:
- Simplicity: Reports are pure functions
- Consistency: Reports always match ledger
- Maintainability: Single source of truth
- Deletion semantics: Delete source data, reports auto-update
- No technical debt: No dual-state systems to maintain

---

## Next Steps

If you need to implement data deletion:

1. Delete from `general_ledger` collection (if needed)
2. Delete from `journal_entries` collection (if needed)
3. Delete from `companies/{id}/invoices` (for AR cleanup)
4. Delete from `companies/{id}/vendorBills` (for AP cleanup)
5. **Stop** - reports automatically reflect all changes
6. No report cleanup needed
