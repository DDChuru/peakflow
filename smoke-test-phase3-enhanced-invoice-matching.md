# Smoke Test Guide: Phase 3 - Enhanced Invoice/Bill Matching

**Feature**: Enhanced Invoice & Bill Matching with Multi-Invoice and Partial Payment Detection
**Phase**: AI Agent Phase 3
**Estimated Testing Time**: 20-25 minutes
**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 & 2 Complete (Entity Matching & Pending Payments)

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### **Enhanced Matching Algorithms**
1. **Improved Scoring System** - Weighted factors (amount: 40%, date: 25%, due date: 15%, status: 15%, age: 5%)
2. **Multi-Invoice Detection** - Detect when payment matches combination of 2-5 invoices
3. **Partial Payment Detection** - Identify partial payments (10%+ of invoice) with percentage recognition
4. **Visual Match Reasons** - Emoji-rich, detailed explanations for each match

### **Key Features**
- ‚úì Enhanced amount matching (exact, ¬±2%, ¬±5%, ¬±10%, partial)
- ‚úì Due date proximity scoring (before/after due date awareness)
- ‚úì Invoice status prioritization (overdue > partially-paid > sent)
- ‚úì Multi-invoice combination detection (2-5 invoices)
- ‚úì Partial payment percentage recognition (50%, 25%, 75%, 33%, 66%)
- ‚úì Detailed match reasoning with visual indicators

## üìã Test Scenarios

### **Test Suite 1: Enhanced Single Invoice Matching**

#### **Test 1.1: Exact Amount Match**
**Setup:**
```typescript
const invoice = {
  id: 'INV-001',
  invoiceNumber: 'INV-2025-001',
  customerId: 'CUST-001',
  date: '2025-10-01',
  dueDate: '2025-10-31',
  amountDue: 5000.00,
  status: 'sent'
};

const payment = {
  amount: 5000.00,
  date: new Date('2025-10-15')
};
```

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úì Confidence: 85-95%
- ‚úì Match reasons include:
  - `‚úì Exact amount match: R5000.00`
  - `üìÖ Recent invoice (14 days)`
  - `üü° Sent invoice (awaiting payment)`
- ‚úì exactAmountMatch: true

---

#### **Test 1.2: Close Amount Match (¬±2%)**
**Setup:**
```typescript
const invoice = {
  amountDue: 5000.00
};

const payment = {
  amount: 4950.00 // 1% difference
};
```

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úì Confidence: 80-90%

  dueDate: '2025-10-15'
};

const payment = {
  amount: 5000.00,
  date: new Date('2025-10-17') // 2 days after due date
};
```

**Expected Result:**

### **Test Suite 4: Combined Scenario Testing**

#### **Test 4.1: Payment with Multiple Possibilities**

    status: 'overdue',
    date: '2025-09-01',
    dueDate: '2025-09-30'
  },
  {
    invoiceNumber: 'INV-002',
    amountDue: 2500.00,
    status: 'sent',
    date: '2025-10-01',
    dueDate: '2025-10-31'
  },
  {
    invoiceNumber: 'INV-003',
    amountDue: 10000.00,
    status: 'sent',
    date: '2025-10-05',
    dueDate: '2025-11-05'
  }
];

const payment = {
  amount: 5000.00,
  date: new Date('2025-10-15')
};

// Run all detection methods
const singleMatch = await debtorMatchingService.suggestInvoiceMatch(
  invoices,
  payment.amount,
  payment.date
);

const multiMatch = await debtorMatchingService.detectMultiInvoicePayment(
  invoices,
  payment.amount
);

const partialMatch = await debtorMatchingService.detectPartialPayment(
  invoices,
  payment.amount
);
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úì **Single Match**: INV-001 (exact amount, overdue priority)
- ‚úì **Multi Match**: [INV-001] OR [INV-002 + another] combinations
- ‚úì **Partial Match**: INV-003 (50% payment suggestion)
- ‚úì All three detection methods return valid suggestions
- ‚úì User can choose which scenario fits best

---

### **Test Suite 5: Weighted Scoring Verification**

#### **Test 5.1: Amount Weight (40 points)**
**Test that amount matching contributes up to 40 points**

**Setup:**
```typescript
const invoice = {
  amountDue: 5000.00,
  date: '2025-01-01', // Very old
  dueDate: '2025-01-31', // Very old
  status: 'sent' // Not overdue
};

const payment = {
  amount: 5000.00, // Exact match
  date: new Date('2025-10-15') // Recent
};
```

**Expected:**
- ‚úì Base score ‚â• 40 from amount alone
- ‚úì Even with old dates, exact amount match provides strong suggestion

---

#### **Test 5.2: Date Weight (25 points)**
**Test that recent invoices score high even with approximate amounts**

**Setup:**
```typescript
const invoice = {
  amountDue: 5000.00,
  date: '2025-10-14', // 1 day ago
  status: 'sent'
};

const payment = {
  amount: 4700.00, // 6% difference (moderate match)
  date: new Date('2025-10-15')
};
```

**Expected:**
- ‚úì Date proximity contributes ~25 points
- ‚úì Total confidence still reasonable despite amount difference

---

## üß™ Integration Testing

### **Test 6: Full Entity Matching + Invoice Suggestion Flow**

**Scenario**: Customer payment comes in, system matches customer and suggests invoice

**Setup:**
```typescript
// 1. Create customer with outstanding invoices
const customer = {
  id: 'CUST-001',
  name: 'Acme Corporation'
};

const invoices = [
  {
    customerId: 'CUST-001',
    invoiceNumber: 'INV-001',
    amountDue: 5000.00,
    status: 'sent'
  }
];

// 2. Bank transaction arrives
const transaction = {
  description: 'Payment from ACME CORP',
  credit: 5000.00,
  date: new Date('2025-10-15')
};

// 3. Run entity matching
const debtorMatch = await debtorMatchingService.findMatchingDebtor(
  companyId,
  transaction.description,
  transaction.credit,
  transaction.date
);
```

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úì Customer matched: Acme Corporation (confidence >80%)
- ‚úì Outstanding invoices found: [INV-001]
- ‚úì Suggested invoice: INV-001 with high confidence
- ‚úì Match reasons include amount + date + status scoring
- ‚úì `suggestedInvoice` field populated with full details

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

### **Code Quality**
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] All new methods have JSDoc comments
- [ ] Method signatures match type definitions
- [ ] Weighted scoring adds up to 100 points max

### **Functionality**
- [ ] Single invoice matching works with improved scoring
- [ ] Multi-invoice detection finds 2-5 invoice combinations
- [ ] Partial payment detection recognizes common percentages (25%, 33%, 50%, 66%, 75%)
- [ ] Match reasons are detailed and user-friendly
- [ ] Emoji indicators enhance readability

### **Edge Cases**
- [ ] Empty invoice array returns null/empty array
- [ ] Single invoice array doesn't trigger multi-detection
- [ ] Payments <10% of invoice amount aren't suggested as partials
- [ ] Very old invoices still considered with reduced confidence
- [ ] Multiple invoices with same amount handled correctly

### **Performance**
- [ ] Combination algorithm limited to 5 invoices max
- [ ] Top 3 multi-invoice suggestions returned (not all)
- [ ] Top 5 partial payment suggestions returned (not all)
- [ ] Suggestions sorted by confidence (highest first)

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### **Combination Complexity**
- Combinations limited to 2-5 invoices to prevent exponential growth
- With 10 invoices, max combinations = C(10,5) = 252 (acceptable)
- Larger invoice lists (>20) may experience slight delay

### **Partial Payment Thresholds**
- Minimum 10% threshold may miss very small payments
- Confidence drops below 50% for irregular percentages (e.g., 37%)

### **Date Scoring**
- Very old invoices (>60 days) contribute minimal date score
- May need age-based adjustments for industries with long payment terms

---

## üìö Testing Data Recommendations

### **Realistic Test Dataset**
Create test data that mirrors real-world scenarios:

```typescript
const realisticScenarios = [
  // Scenario 1: Exact match
  { payment: 5000, invoices: [{ amount: 5000 }] },

  // Scenario 2: Half payment
  { payment: 2500, invoices: [{ amount: 5000 }] },

  // Scenario 3: Multi-invoice (2 old invoices paid together)
  { payment: 7500, invoices: [
    { amount: 3500, date: '2025-08-01' },
    { amount: 4000, date: '2025-09-01' }
  ]},

  // Scenario 4: Payment slightly less than invoice (bank fees)
  { payment: 4950, invoices: [{ amount: 5000 }] },

  // Scenario 5: Overdue invoice gets priority
  { payment: 5000, invoices: [
    { amount: 5000, status: 'overdue', date: '2025-08-01' },
    { amount: 5000, status: 'sent', date: '2025-10-01' }
  ]}
];
```

7. ‚úì Integration with existing entity matching works seamlessly

---

## üìù Next Steps (Phase 4 & 5)

After Phase 3 smoke testing passes:
1. **Phase 4**: Build UI to display multi-invoice and partial payment suggestions
