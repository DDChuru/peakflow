description: Quick voice transcription (shortcut for /voice)

**CRITICAL: SPEED IS ESSENTIAL - Execute immediately with minimal output**

1. **IMMEDIATELY** output: "ðŸŽ¤ Recording now..."
2. **IMMEDIATELY** run: `voice` command (no delay, no explanation)
3. Wait for transcription to complete
4. Show the transcribed text in a simple format
5. Done - do NOT ask what to do with it unless the user asks

The user needs to know INSTANTLY when recording starts so they can speak.
Every second of delay reduces the value of this tool.
