# Dashboard Update Summary

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. **Fixed Broken Quick Action Links**
- âœ… Invoices link: `/workspace/{id}/invoices` (was `/invoices/new`)
- âœ… Quotes link: `/workspace/{id}/quotes` (was `/quotes/new`)
- âœ… Bank Reconciliation: `/workspace/{id}/bank-import` (was `/reconciliation`)
- âœ… Payments: `/workspace/{id}/statements` (was `/payments/record`)
- âœ… **NEW**: Opening Balances link (admin-only): `/workspace/{id}/setup/opening-balances`

### 2. **Replaced Mock Data with Real Financial Data**

| Metric | Before (Mock) | After (Real) |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Cash Position | $125,000 | Sum of all bank account balances |
| Outstanding AR | $42,000 | Total unpaid invoices |
| Unpaid Bills | $18,000 | Total due on vendor bills |
| Monthly Revenue | $85,000 | $0 (placeholder - needs GL query) |
| Revenue Growth | 12.5% | 0% (placeholder - needs historical data) |
| Expense Growth | 8.3% | 0% (placeholder - needs historical data) |

**Data Sources**:
```typescript
// Cash Position
bankAccountService.getAccountBalanceSummary(companyId)

// Outstanding Receivables
invoiceService.getInvoicesSummary(companyId)
â†’ totalAmount - paidAmount

// Unpaid Bills
vendorBillService.getVendorBillSummary()
â†’ totalDue
```

### 3. **Added Dynamic Currency Support**
- âœ… Loads company's default currency
- âœ… All amounts now show correct currency symbol:
  - **Orlicron (ZAR)**: R50,000.00
  - **US Companies (USD)**: $50,000.00
  - **EU Companies (EUR)**: â‚¬50,000.00
- âœ… Applied to all 4 metric cards

### 4. **Replaced Mock Action Items**
- âœ… **Before**: Hardcoded "5 Overdue Invoices - $12,500"
- âœ… **After**: Real overdue invoices from `invoiceService.getInvoiceAging()`
  - Only shows if company actually has overdue invoices
  - Correct amount based on aging buckets (31-60, 61-90, 91-120, 120+ days)
  - Currency-aware description

   - [ ] Outstanding AR matches unpaid invoices
   - [ ] Unpaid Bills matches vendor bills
   - [ ] No mock values (125000, 85000, etc.)

3. **Test Quick Action Links**:
   - [ ] Click "Invoices" â†’ Goes to `/workspace/{id}/invoices`
   - [ ] Click "Quotes" â†’ Goes to `/workspace/{id}/quotes`
   - [ ] Click "Bank Import" â†’ Goes to `/workspace/{id}/bank-import`
   - [ ] Click "Statements" â†’ Goes to `/workspace/{id}/statements`
   - [ ] Click "Opening Balances" (admin only) â†’ Goes to setup page

4. **Test Action Items**:
