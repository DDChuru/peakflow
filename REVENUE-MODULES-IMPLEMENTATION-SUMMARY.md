## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Firestore Data Integrity ✅
**Problem:** Forms were sending `undefined` values to Firestore, causing errors
**Solution:** Conditional field inclusion pattern

```typescript
// Build base object with required fields
const data: any = {
  name: formData.name,
  status: formData.status,
  // ... required fields
};

// Only add optional fields if they have values
if (formData.email) data.email = formData.email;
if (formData.phone) data.phone = formData.phone;
```

**Applied to:**
- ✅ Invoices module - Create and Edit handlers
- ✅ Contracts module - Create and Edit handlers
- ✅ Quotes module - Create and Edit handlers
- ✅ Customer forms - Previously fixed
- ✅ Supplier forms - Previously fixed

### 2. Form Validation with Zod ✅
All modules now use Zod schemas for:
- Required field validation
- Type checking (numbers, dates, enums)
- Min/max constraints
- Custom error messages
- Real-time validation feedback

### 3. Service Layer Integration ✅
**Services Used:**
- `InvoiceService` - Invoice CRUD, payment recording, GL posting
- `SLAService` - Contract CRUD
- `DebtorService` - Customer lookups for dropdowns
- `ChartOfAccountsService` - GL account dropdowns (revenue accounts only)

### 4. Dynamic Line Items ✅
**Features:**
- Add/remove line items dynamically
- Auto-calculate amount = quantity × unit price
- Auto-calculate tax amount = amount × (tax rate / 100)
- Real-time total calculations
- GL account selection per line item

---

## Invoice-Specific Features

### Payment Recording
```typescript
// Payment dialog captures:
- Payment date
- Payment amount (validated against amountDue)
- Payment method (cash, check, bank transfer, card, other)
- Transaction reference
- Notes
```

**Payment Workflow:**
1. User clicks "Record Payment" on sent/partial/overdue invoice
2. Dialog pre-fills with invoice's amountDue
3. User enters payment details
4. System updates:
   - `amountPaid` += payment amount
   - `amountDue` -= payment amount
   - `status` → "paid" (if full) or "partial" (if partial)
   - Adds payment to `paymentHistory` array

### Post to General Ledger
```typescript
// Creates journal entry:
Dr. Accounts Receivable (totalAmount)
Cr. Revenue accounts (per line item)
```

**GL Posting Workflow:**
1. User clicks "Post to GL" on sent/paid invoice
2. System creates journal entry
3. Invoice stores `journalEntryId`
4. Action removed from menu (can't post twice)

---

## Status Workflows

### Contracts/SLA
- `draft` → `active` → `suspended` → `expired` / `cancelled`

### Quotes
- `draft` → `sent` → `accepted` / `rejected` / `expired` → `converted` (if accepted)

### Invoices
- `draft` → `sent` → `paid` / `partial` / `overdue` / `cancelled`

---

## Files Modified

3. 📊 Verify GL posting creates correct journal entries

### Future Enhancements
1. 🔔 Email notifications for sent invoices/quotes
2. 📄 PDF generation for invoices/quotes
3. 🤖 SLA auto-billing scheduled task (configuration ready, needs scheduler)
4. 📊 Revenue forecasting based on contracts
5. 💳 Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal)
6. 📧 Customer portal for viewing invoices/quotes

## Technical Notes

### Conditional Field Inclusion Pattern
This pattern is now standard across all forms:

```typescript
// ❌ DON'T DO THIS (causes Firestore errors)
const data = {
  name: formData.name,
  email: formData.email || undefined, // undefined not allowed!
};

// ✅ DO THIS (only include if value exists)
const data: any = {
  name: formData.name, // required field
};
if (formData.email) data.email = formData.email; // optional field
```

### Form Validation Pattern
```typescript
const {
  register,
  handleSubmit,
  formState: { errors, isValid }, // Extract isValid
} = useForm<FormData>({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema),
});

// Use isValid to disable submit button
<Button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting || !isValid}>
  Submit
</Button>
```
