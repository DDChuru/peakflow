## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Real Entity Search (Next Priority)
Currently, AI can tell users about entity matching but doesn't actually execute searches.

**Implement**:
- Direct calls to `DebtorMatchingService.findMatchingDebtor()`
- Direct calls to `CreditorMatchingService.findMatchingCreditor()`
- Return actual search results in AI response

**Example**:
```
User: "Find customer Advanced Cleaning"
AI: ✅ Found match:
    - Name: Advanced Cleaning Services
    - Match: 87% confidence
    - Outstanding: R21,919.00
    - Invoices: 3 (INV-2025-034, INV-2025-021, INV-2025-003)
```

### Phase 2: Invoice/Bill Lookup
- Search invoices by number, amount, or customer
- Search bills by number, amount, or supplier
- Link directly to invoice/bill pages

### Phase 3: Financial Analysis Tools
- Balance sheet queries
- P&L analysis
- Cash flow projections
- Trend analysis

### Phase 4: Bulk Operations
- "Mark all Eskom payments as utilities expense"
- "Approve all VAT mappings"
- "Create rule for all customer payments"

### Phase 5: Accounting Tutor Expansion
- Interactive lessons
- Quiz mode for accounting concepts
- Study guides for IFRS/GAAP
- Certification prep help

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "AI Assistant not configured" error

**Cause**: Missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in environment variables

**Fix**:
1. Add to `.env.local`: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Verify key is loaded in console logs

---

### Issue: AI responses are slow

**Possible Causes**:
- Network latency to Anthropic API
- Using older model (Haiku/Opus)
- Large conversation history

**Fixes**:
1. Check network connection
2. Ensure using Sonnet 4.5: `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
3. Clear chat to reset history

---

### Issue: AI gives generic answers (not using company data)

**Possible Cause**: Chart of accounts not loading properly

**Fix**:
1. Check console for errors loading COA
2. Verify `chartOfAccountsService.getAccounts(companyId)` returns data
3. Check Firestore rules allow reading accounts

---

### Issue: AI paraphrases entity names

**Should NOT Happen** - System prompt explicitly forbids this.

**If it happens**:
1. Check system prompt in `buildGeneralChatSystemPrompt()`
2. Verify "USE EXACT NAMES" instruction is present
3. Report as AI behavior issue (may need prompt tuning)
