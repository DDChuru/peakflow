## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Zooming
**Symptoms:** Logo doesn't zoom on hover
**Fix:**
- Check CSS classes include: `transition-transform duration-300 hover:scale-110`
- Verify Tailwind CSS properly compiling
- Check browser console for CSS errors

### Banking Details Wrong Order
**Symptoms:** Banking appears after terms instead of before
**Fix:**
- In `/app/workspace/[companyId]/quotes/page.tsx`
- Verify banking details JSX appears before terms & conditions JSX
- Check around lines 1836-1891 for view, lines 680-721 for PDF

### Branch Code Not Saving
**Symptoms:** Branch code field filled but not saved to Firestore
**Fix:**
- Check conditional inclusion in `handleCreateAccount`
- Should have: `if (accountForm.branchCode.trim()) accountData.branchCode = accountForm.branchCode.trim();`
- Verify no undefined value errors in console

### PDF Header Background Missing
**Symptoms:** Banking header in PDF has no background color
**Fix:**
- Check pdfmake table layout has `fillColor: () => '#eef2ff'`
- Verify `bankingHeader` style exists in styles object
- Check PDF generation code around line 680-721

### Branch Code Shows When Empty
**Symptoms:** "Branch Code:" label shows with no value
**Fix:**
- Check conditional rendering: `{primaryBankAccount.branchCode && <div>...}</div>}`
- Verify spread operator in PDF: `...(primaryBankAccount.branchCode ? [...] : [])`

## Edge Cases

### Multiple Bank Accounts
